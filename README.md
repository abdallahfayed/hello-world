# hello-world
I am an Egyptian electrical engineer from Alexandria, Egypt who is currently based on Munich, Germany. I am currently a full-time research assosciate at Institute of Communications Engineering at TU Munich doing my PhD in Electrical Engineering. My  current research interests span information theory, information-theoretic security, statistics, optimization and machine learning; as well as their various applications in various domains. Besides research I am basically interested in everything, from politics to economics, and the relationship between them. To history, philosophy, sociology and their various manifestations. I have also a strong interest in the arts and literature. The github account including the blog stemming from it will be a rather quite and secluded to organize my scrambles of ideas, impressions and aspiring knowledge to what anything that might somehow resemble cohesiveness. I am committed to public discussion of things that interest me as well. I might try to post on the blog in either English or Arabic.
